Every team member played a critical role in the project’s success. For example, the product owner refined user stories, the tester carefully designed test cases, and consistent communication between the tester and the rest of the team helped define clear requirements for developers to meet client expectations. The developers’ responsiveness to client feedback demonstrated an ideal attitude for success, and the collaboration between developers and testers ensured that the submitted code was of the highest quality.

As Scrum Master, facilitating communication during standups and other Scrum ceremonies was vital to maintaining team cohesion and preventing misunderstandings. Once we fully adopted an agile approach to the Software Development Lifecycle, our team began completing user stories more quickly and reduced bottlenecks in our workflow. For instance, when redesigning the SNHU Travel application from a basic list format to a slideshow layout, what could have been a major disruption in a traditional waterfall process was handled smoothly through agile methods, allowing testing and documentation to be completed as each story was finished.

We successfully transformed plain business requirements into user stories and test cases, and the team managed major project changes efficiently to satisfy stakeholders. The Scrum/agile framework enabled flexibility and adaptability—something that’s far more difficult to achieve in a waterfall model. This adaptability was supported not only by the skill and dedication of team members but also by the structure of agile ceremonies, which promote transparency and ensure everyone stays aligned when changes occur.

Daily standups emphasized openness and honesty, allowing team members to discuss challenges, workload concerns, or uncertainties freely. Effective communication—such as asking for clarification on user stories, identifying obstacles, or discussing the scope of work—was a key factor in our project’s success. Likewise, collaboration during sprint planning and backlog refinement enhanced engagement and ensured everyone understood business priorities and requirements.

For any new agile project, selecting the right organizational tools is crucial for adapting to the agile workflow, visualizing progress, and measuring team productivity. Throughout this project, it became clear that adopting a Scrum-agile approach was the best choice to keep the project on track. Many challenges that arose during sprints would have taken significantly more time and effort under a waterfall method. While there were minor drawbacks—such as ensuring consistent attendance and engagement at Scrum events—the benefits far outweighed them. Overall, the Scrum-agile methodology proved to be the most effective and efficient approach for this development project and one I will continue to apply in my future career as a software developer.
